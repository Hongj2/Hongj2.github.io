Hi!  My name is Jessica, and I never imagined that I would be here typing a blog about my journey to become a software developer. 

I have a background in biology and psychology with a minor in chemistry. One would see me as a science overachiever, but society will see Bachelor of arts from a small college. I work for a cancer hospital as a clinic coordinator, where I efficiently juggle clinical staffs and patients to run a good clinic. But, I often see how our archaic  systems are failing both providers and patients. Programs that are meant to create a smoother care experience are lacking updates that could improve patient's care and their way of life in dealing with cancer. The culture of the work community is stained with poor management and lack of opportunites to invest in their workers to better the work environment. So, I sought out to do more. 

I thought I would follow my original career pathway to become a surgical physician assistant, but after being exposed to the work environment, I have realized that my heart is not there for this position. A physician assistant is by no mean a horrible career, I just didn't see myself in that role. The problem is that everything that I have done so far in my first quarter-life was towards this role, and I do not have any other knowledge or awareness of anything else. But, I know that I am creative and an adaptable learner. I began to talk in-depth with other people in regards to their occupations and interests in hopes that something would spark and something did. Coding. 

I tinkled with coding before. I once had a crush and went to the Facebook source page to find his identification and his ranking in my friend list with the thought that higher his ranking the more he has interacted with my profile (it was a silly infatuation). Another time during finals week, I manually removed access to Facebook and YouTube websites on my computer through terminal. It was fun to fiddle with it, but I never gave much thought afterward until now. Now, I see it as a challenge that tests my creativity and logic to solve problems presented to me. I invite the idea of being pushed and challenged, and I look forward to being frustrated with these challenges because completing them are rewarding. 

 By investing myself in this field, to come out with this powerful skill in my pocket then just maybe  I would be able to contribute a more meaningful impact to patients and providers in this hospital and maybe in this world and this lifetime.
