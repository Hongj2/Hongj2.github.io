How are Variables and Methods a metaphor for life?


A  variable is an adjective and by definition,: not consistent or having a fixed pattern; liable to change. 

The way I see variable, its application in a ruby either as a class variable or a local variable, draw parallels into our lives.  We humans individually are local variables confined in a scope defined by our given attributes.  We grow, change, and even adapt to what life has thrown at us.  those circumstances of change can be identified as methods!  

The method in the context of Ruby is a set of expressions that can alter the variable and outputs the changed variable. The changed variable can now achieve further in a block of code and results in the production of a completely different variable. 

That is how I see variables and methods as metaphors for life.  Within our scope of perception, we can only do so much because we, the variables, would be deleted at our end.  As melodramatic as that can sound, we can look at our class variables as the silver lining.  we individually may not be able to accomplish a lot but as a global variable, the human share common attributes of empathy and compassion for one and another.
