This was an extremely fustrating first project. 

The concept of this project is very simple. You scrape a page, gather information on specific items, intialize/create each item as an instance of an object, and save it into an array. Then you go a level deeper by going into each individual item collecting specfic information and then identified them as attributes of each item instance. 

From the beginning, there are many challenges to overcome to even start the project - from finding a website to scrape and finding the will to do it. I knew I need to do something that is of my interest or else i would lose interest quickly, so i decided to do a website about Game of Thrones.  

The inital scraping wasn't difficult but creating object realtionship and initiating was a lot more complex than i originally thought. Through and through, I am so greatful for our cohort leader and cohort group that are serious in their plight to foster kind, helpful, and great networking groups that are so willing to help each other. I feel that i have grown tremendiously from this project as a learner and was exposed to many interactions that one may see in their future roles. Through stressful at time, this is a great introductions to real life software development.
