This project subjected more pain than the last. 

This project made me realize how difficult it is to be in a boot camp while balancing a full-time job, my social life, and my resurging dating life. It also made me realize something, despite my now constant frustration at the lack of my skill and strength to continue in this path. I realized how far I have come from not knowing a single thing about software development to now being semi able to code on my own.

This project is a reflection of my ability to adapt and the fruit of my hard work.  The concept of Sinatra is very similar to me, where I am lightweight, basic, and provides minimal support in the development of dynamic web applications. 
 I enjoyed the breakdown of the MVC (model, view, and control) concepts that helped me to better visualize, how I use my controllers to route to my views with the understanding of model data being pulled from active records. The file structure also provides a level of clarity and organization based on their functions. 

This project is simple, it is just an application that allows a user to sign-up, log-in/out, and CRUD a riddle. It was a really simple application, but it was full of mental roadblocks and breakdowns - this was the final product in spite of those mental challenges. The result was not the best, but it was full of hard work and growth in this field.
